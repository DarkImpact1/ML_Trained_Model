## 1. Movie Recommender System
Our movie recommender system is powered by machine learning, trained on a dataset of 5000 movies from Tmdb. 
Using sophisticated algorithms, it analyzes user searches to recommend the next few movies tailored to their preferences.
By understanding various movie attributes such as genre, cast, and plot, our system provides personalized suggestions for
an enjoyable viewing experience. Whether users seek similar films or new genres to explore, our recommender leverages the 
richness of the Tmdb dataset to offer curated selections. With its intuitive interface and accurate predictions, 
our system enhances the movie-watching journey by delivering relevant recommendations for every user.

## 2. IMDb Review Classifier

IMDb Review Classifier is a machine learning-based web application that analyzes movie reviews to 
predict whether they are positive or negative.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DarkImpact1/ML_Trained_Model.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ML_Trained_Model
   ```

3. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

5. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to use the application.

### Model Training

The machine learning model used in this application was trained on IMDb movie review data. The training code is available in the `train_model.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- streamlit
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- nltk

### Acknowledgements
